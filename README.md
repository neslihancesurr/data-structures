# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository was created as part of my Teaching Assistantship for the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course. The algorithms and methods implemented here are primarily based on the textbook *Data Structures and Algorithms* by Olcay Taner YÄ±ldÄ±z.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to help students:

- Understand fundamental data structures and their implementations.
- Develop new methods to manipulate these structures.
- Practice debugging and testing their code with diverse test cases.

### Important Notes

- Certain edge cases, particularly those related to input constraints, have not been handled.
- Some assumptions were made to simplify implementations, as the primary goal is to teach the core concepts.
- Inheritance was intentionally avoided to maintain clarity, despite potential code repetition.

The repository also includes a **Slides** directory with presentation materials used in weekly revision sessions.
